## 👋 Hi, I’m UMESH HANUMANAGOUDA
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring the world where Data Science makes a difference.
- 🌱 I’m currently updating about cloud computing and have completed Data Science and GenAI. Looking for opportunities to apply the learnings for greater benefits.
- 🔎 You can review the recent repositories about the Data Science projects with modular coding approach and exploration of MLOPs tools.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Data Science projects to learn the application of the same to solve real-world problems.
- 📫 How to reach me: mail me at umesh11m266@gmail.com

I am a passionate and results-driven Junior Data Scientist with a strong foundation in machine learning, data analysis, and predictive modeling. I collaborate with cross-functional teams to deliver data-driven solutions that drive business growth and efficiency. My expertise lies in fraud detection, customer analytics, credit scoring, and time-series forecasting, where I leverage machine learning and advanced algorithms like XGBoost, LightGBM, ARIMA, and LSTM to extract actionable insights from complex datasets.

With a background in Mechanical Engineering from the National Institute of Technology Karnataka, I bring a unique blend of technical and analytical skills to the table. My transition from Executive Manager at Coal India Limited to Data Science showcases my adaptability and commitment to continuous learning. I am certified in Data Science, Generative AI, and AWS Cloud, and I am always eager to explore new technologies and methodologies to solve real-world problems.

I thrive in collaborative environments and have hands-on experience with tools like Python, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and PySpark. My freelance projects, including developing data entry web apps and sentiment analysis dashboards, reflect my ability to deliver end-to-end solutions tailored to business needs.

When I'm not crunching numbers, you can find me honing my skills on Leetcode, and HackerRank, where I hold a 5-star Gold badge in both Python and SQL. I am excited about opportunities to contribute to innovative projects and make a meaningful impact through data science.

#### Thank you
